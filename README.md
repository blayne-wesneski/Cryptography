# Cryptography
A repo containing every single program I wrote for my cryptography class rewritten to work as a single program. I am mostly doing this to cut down on the number of repos I have, and I also just kind of wanted to combine them all.

You can run the program by running driver.py

The original Readme's for each program as well as the dates on which they were written can be found below.
